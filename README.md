# Weather app

This is a **weather app** I made to practice javascript.
**This Web app has been made using vanilla JS! No frameworks has been used**
This app can,
1. Get Location data using HTML5 location service
2. Contact Openweather API and get weather data
3. Convert temp from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice-versa.
and has a barebones UI  :p


# How to Run.

Just clone the repo and run the **index.html** in the browser.
Grant the app location permission when prompted.
